# landsatSource64

Code for offset tracking in pairs of Landsat image with the same path row. The code is a bit slow but still servicable.

Some of the routines are also needed to compile [mosaic3d](https://github.com/fastice/mosaicSource).

This is production code. Most users will be better served by an extensive set of [Jupyter Notebooks and Python packages](https://github.com/fastice/GrIMPTools) to work with the GrIMP [products](https://nsidc.org/data/measures/grimp).
